# PesaIQ — Architecture

Stage 1 (Expo Go). Last updated 2026-09-11, end of Phase 1A.

## Principle

Local-first. A message is pasted, parsed on device, and written to a local SQLite
database. Nothing leaves the phone unless the user exports it.

## Data flow

```
Paste (ManualSmsSource)
      ↓
Normalizer          original text preserved, never mutated
      ↓
Classifier          12 categories + explainable reasons[]
      ↓
Parser engine       GenericParser + provider hints
      ↓
ParseResult         Zod-validated, per-field confidence
      ↓
Confidence          weighted factors → band
      ↓
User confirms / edits
      ↓
TransactionRepository → SQLite
      ↓
Selectors (pure)    health · categories · tips · totals · filters
      ↓
Dashboard
```

## Layers

| Layer | Holds | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `app/` | Expo Router screens | No SQL, no regex. Reads through stores/selectors. |
| `components/` | Presentational UI | No data fetching. |
| `features/` | Domain logic (parser, transactions, insights) | Pure and unit-testable. |
| `database/` | Schema, migrations, repositories | The only place SQL is written. |
| `services/` | `SmsSource`, export, storage | Side effects live here. |
| `theme/` | Design tokens | Ported from the canvas; no hard-coded colors elsewhere. |
| `ai/` | Interfaces, schemas, prompts | Abstraction only in Stage 1. Not wired to a provider. |

**UI never touches SQLite directly.** Screens call repositories or selectors. This
is what lets the prototype's in-memory state become real persistence without
rewriting view code.

## The Stage 2 seam

SMS ingestion is behind one interface:

```ts
interface SmsSource {
  start(): Promise<void>;
  stop(): Promise<void>;
}
```

Stage 1 ships `ManualSmsSource` (pasted text) only. Stage 2 adds `AndroidSmsSource`
(BroadcastReceiver + native module, Expo Dev Build) behind the same interface.
Everything downstream of the source is unchanged. **No native SMS code exists yet
and none is faked.**

## Phase 1A — what is built

- Expo SDK 57 · React Native 0.86.3 · React 19.2.3 · TypeScript 6, Expo Router with
  typed routes.
- `theme/` — colors, ramps, spacing, radii, type scale, violet-tinted elevation,
  ported from the 2026-09-11 canvas revision.
- `components/ui/` — `Text`, `Card`, `Button`, `Tag`, `Screen`.
- Plus Jakarta Sans loaded at the root behind the splash screen.
- ESLint (flat config) + Prettier + Jest (`jest-expo`).
- `app/index.tsx` is a temporary foundation check; Phase 1B replaces it.

## Decisions

- **Zustand** for app state (the prototype is one reactive store; Zustand maps to it
  cleanly). Added in Phase 1C when there is state to hold.
- **English-only UI.** The 2026-09-11 design revision removed Swahili from the
  interface, so no i18n layer ships. SMS *content* is still Swahili and the parser
  must match Swahili keywords.
- **`react-dom` is pinned to 19.2.3** to match the React version Expo pins. A
  hoisted 19.3.0 otherwise breaks peer resolution.
